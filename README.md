AI TECH GAME USING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ( DEEP Q LEARNING) WITH PYTORCH

* RL is teaching a software agent how to behave in an environment by telling it how good it’s doing.
* Deep Q Learning extends reinforcement learning by using a deep neural network to predict the actions.

Process or Steps:




Feed Forward Neural Network :

* These models are called feedforward because information ?ows through the function being evaluated from x, through the intermediate computations used to de?ne f, and ?nally to the output y. There are no feedback connections in which outputs of the model are fed back into itself.



DEEP Q LEARNING:
Q value = Quality of action
1. Init Q value (= init model)
2. Choose action (model.predict(state))
3. Perform action
4. Measure reward
5. Update Q value ( + train model)
6. Repeat the process from step 1
